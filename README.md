Postcode V2 is a fork of [Postcode](https://github.com/rohinivsenthil/postcode) that adds support for saving and organizing requests into collections. Create and test HTTP/s requests, then save them for later.

## Highlighted Features

- **Save requests** to collections and reload them anytime
- **Intuitive UI/UX** similar to Postman, fits seamlessly with any VS Code theme
- Supports **GraphQL** requests
- Supports **code snippet generation** from requests

## Quick start

1. Install the Postcode V2 extension for Visual Studio Code
2. Click the Postcode icon in the activity bar OR run **Postcode: Create Request**
3. Create your HTTP/s request and hit Send
4. To save a request, use the Save button in the request bar, then choose a collection

## Collections

Requests are saved to collections (stored per-workspace). Right-click collections or requests to rename or delete them.
